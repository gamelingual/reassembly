# "Fixed as ""Press … button"" so that to be consistent with the Official translation, as all strings with ""press"" had ""button"" followed up.

# Retranslated as "By spwaning a design in which there's factory yet no thruster, build a new station. If the newly discovered unactivated station is avaiable, then this station will spawn new station in your fleet screen. " I am not sure what is a fleet screen, both translation doesn't mention it. Official one says it's "fleet interface", but if it's an interface, then the preposition would be ON the screen, maybe?
